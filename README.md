## :bulb: Repository Idea

The idea of the repository is to solve [HackerRank](https://hackerrank.com/). platform logic and data structures problems. The problems are divider for difficulty levels, and each problem has a explanation and examples of the input and output data.

## :face_exhaling: Problems solved

:white_check_mark: Solve me first

- The idea of the problem is simple, just add two numbers.

### Example

#### Input <br>

a = 7 <br>
b = 3

#### Output <br>

```bash
10
```

:white_check_mark: Simple Array Sum

- This problem idea is get array values and sum your elements.

### Example

#### Input <br>

[1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 11]

#### Output <br>

```bash
31
```

:white_check_mark: Compare the Triplets

- This problem is a little more "complex", we need to compare the points of alice and bob, and whoever has the highest score wins. After checking we return the score of each

### Example

#### Input <br>

a = [1, 2, 3] <br>
b = [3, 2, 1] <br>

#### Output

```bash
1 1
```

:white_check_mark: A Very Big Sum

- In this challenge, we need to calculate the sum of the elements in an array.

:white_check_mark: Plus Minus

- The platform provides an array of integers. We need to calculate the elements that are negative, positive and zero and return the decimal value of each fraction in a new line with n values.

:white_check_mark: Stair Case

- This challange provides an integers and we need to build a staircase of hashtags, like to example:

```bash
   #
  ##
 ###
####
```

:white_check_mark: Stair Case

- We have five positive integers and we have to find minimum and maximum that can be calculated by summing exactly four of the five integers

### Example

arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

The minimum sum is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 16 and the maximum sum is 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 24. The function prints:

```bash
16 24
```

:white_check_mark: Stair Case

- we received a integers array and we need to count how many numbers repeat

### Example

candles = [4, 4, 1, 3]

The maximum height candles are 4 units high. There are 2 of them, so return 2.

```bash
2
```

## :hammer_and_wrench: Tech

- Javascript
